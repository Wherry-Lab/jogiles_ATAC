PSEA



Required files:


DESeq2 normalized counts table (deseq_normcounts.csv)
Column names: chr, start, end, peakID, samples…


Previously generated peaksets of interest 
.grp file peakset_peakIDs (no column names)
.bed file (chr, start, end, peakset_peakID) (no columns names)


Run R script -- 
Generates union peak list bed file from deseq_normcounts.csv

Run psea_findOverlaps.sh —
To find overlapping peaks between experimental peaks and peaksets

Run R script --
Reads in .grp peakset files 
Reads in overlap files from psea_findOverlaps.sh 
Unifies naming schemes
Outputs stats from overla and peak renaming
Outputs normalized counts table & modified peakset.grp files for gsea

--> Run gsea (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp)
